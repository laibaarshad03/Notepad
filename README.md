This is a simple c++ notepad implemented using two data structures AVL tree and Doubly Linked List. Each note is a doubly linked list and the
whole notepad is an AVL tree. Each node of the AVL consists of a doubly linked list. The functionalities implemented in this notepad have been
explained in the proposal attached. The proposal also contains some snapshots of debugged code.
